## Tips for Travelling from {suburb} to Avalon Airport

Planning ahead can make a world of difference when catching a flight â€” especially from a suburb like **{suburb}**, where youâ€™re within easy reach of both Avalon and Tullamarine airports. Here are our top tips to make your airport journey smooth and stress-free:

- **Book Early** â€“ Avalon Airport may be smaller than Tullamarine, but it still gets busy during weekends, school holidays, and special events. Booking in advance ensures you get your preferred time slot and vehicle.
- **Double-Check Your Terminal** â€“ While Avalon is compact and easy to navigate, knowing your airline's terminal helps speed things up and reduces stress. For Tullamarine, this is especially important due to multiple terminals and traffic congestion.
- **Leave Some Buffer Time** â€“ Avalon Airport is known for its shorter queues and smoother check-ins, but it's still smart to plan ahead. We recommend leaving **at least 2 hours** before a domestic flight.
- **Travel Light or Let Us Know** â€“ Carrying sporting equipment, prams, or extra luggage? Let us know at the time of booking. We'll make sure the right vehicle is dispatched and youâ€™re not squeezed for space.
- **Consider Off-Peak Travel** â€“ If your schedule allows, travelling outside peak hours means quicker road travel and a more relaxed airport experience â€” especially helpful for Avalon, which has limited peak-period access routes.
